\*\* What is middleware

Middleware in the context of web development, and specifically in frameworks like Express.js, refers to functions that have access to the request, response, and the next function in the application's request-response cycle. These functions can modify the request or response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack.

Middleware functions play a crucial role in Express.js applications, allowing developers to add custom functionality to the request-response cycle. They are executed sequentially in the order they are defined in the code.

**Here's a basic example to illustrate the concept**

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function
const logMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Incoming request at ${new Date()}`);
  next(); // Call the next middleware in the stack
};

// Use the middleware for all routes
app.use(logMiddleware);

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});

```
